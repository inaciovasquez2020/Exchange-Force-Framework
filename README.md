# Exchange-Force-Framework

This repository contains the research implementation and theoretical framework for exchange forces within the Universal Reference Frame (URF) ecosystem. It is an indexed component of the Vasquez research suite.

## Overview
The `Exchange-Force-Framework` module provides the computational logic and mathematical structures for modeling exchange-force interactions.

## Canonical Registry
This repository is a registered module of the Vasquez Index. Stable references, archival DOIs, and reproducibility links are maintained at:
* [Vasquez Index Dashboard](https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/dashboard.html)

## Repository Status
* **Repository Handle:** inaciovasquez2020/Exchange-Force-Framework
* **Stability:** Refer to the Vasquez Index for the latest stable DOI and version history.
* **Infrastructure:** [scientific-infrastructure](https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/scientific-infrastructure)
