Exchange Force Framework

This repository contains the canonical structural note for the Exchange Force framework:
a derived-interaction classification and its information-theoretic capacity invariant (ECC).

Contents
- README.md: canonical statement (this file)
- STATUS.md: proven vs conditional vs open items
- CITATION.cff: citation metadata
- LICENSE: MIT

Core definitions
- Exchange Force Type I: symmetry-driven exchange interaction
- Exchange Force Type II: mediator-driven exchange interaction
- ECC (Exchange Correlation Capacity): invariant measuring correlation support

Status
- Conceptual foundations are stated as structural results.
- Quantitative rigidity results remain conditional or open.
See STATUS.md for the authoritative boundary.

Scope
This repository is intentionally minimal and statement-only.
- No claims beyond STATUS.md
- No implementations
- No numerical experiments

## Exchange-Force Certification (Released)

This repository includes a released certification layer for the Exchange-Force Framework.

Scope:
- Structural definitions and deterministic computations
- Exchange-force modeling under explicit constraints

Non-scope:
- No experimental claims
- No new fundamental forces asserted
- No claims beyond certified artifacts

Certification artifacts are verifiable and immutable once released.
