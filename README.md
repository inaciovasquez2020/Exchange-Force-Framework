# Exchange Force Framework  
**Relational Interaction Axioms and Structural Force Closure**

---

## Scope

This repository is a **Tier A module** in the **Scientific Infrastructure (URF)**.  
It defines the **interaction layer** of the Unified Rigidity Framework.

It contains:
- relational coupling axioms,
- exchange interaction operators,
- structural force closure principles,
- deterministic interaction constraints.

No simulations, heuristics, or stochastic models are used.  
All results are analytic and structural.

## Institutional Verification

- **Registry ID:** ART-EXF-01  
- **Status:** Definitions Closed / Theorems Conditional  
- **Framework Alignment:** Unified Rigidity Framework (URF) — Interaction Layer

## Significance Statement

The **Exchange Force Framework** provides the canonical theory of  
**how rigid systems interact without destroying rigidity**.

It formalizes **relational coupling constraints** ensuring that:

- independent rigid systems remain rigid when coupled,
- interaction terms do not collapse global spectral gaps,
- force closure is structurally enforced.

This bridges single-system rigidity with **multi-system force stability**.

## Core Results

### 1. Exchange Interaction Axioms

Formal definition of state-swap and coupling operators
between admissible rigid systems.

### 2. Structural Force Closure

Interaction equilibria must preserve rigidity invariants.

### 3. Relational Coupling Constraint

For coupled systems \(H_A\) and \(H_B\):

\[
\mathrm{Spec}(\Delta_{A+B}) \approx \mathrm{Spec}(\Delta_A) \otimes \mathrm{Spec}(\Delta_B)
\]

ensuring no collapse of global structure.

---

## Mathematical Context

Exchange forces are modeled as bounded perturbations
on admissible operator systems.

The interaction operator \(V_{int}\) is constrained so that
the combined system remains within the URF admissibility class.

This provides a structural alternative to:
- perturbative QFT heuristics,
- empirical force fitting,
- stochastic interaction models.

## Artifacts & Lifecycle

- **Core Definitions:** Locked (v1.0)  
- **Formal Closure:** Conditional (relational instantiation ongoing)  
- **Verification Certificates:** To be registered via URF-SG  

This module functions as the **interaction spine** of URF.

## Reproducibility

All results are analytic and deterministic.

Verification consists of:
