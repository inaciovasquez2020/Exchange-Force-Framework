## Significance Statement
The **Exchange Force Framework** provides the canonical reference for the structural regime of exchange interactions. It formalizes the **Relational Coupling Constraints** that dictate how independent rigid systems interact. This framework bridges the gap between individual system rigidity and the collective force closure of multi-body relational networks.

## Core Results
* **Exchange Interaction Axioms:** Formal definition of state-swap operators within rigid structures.
* **Structural Force Closure:** Principles governing the equilibrium of relational forces.
* **Relational Coupling:** Constraints ensuring the preservation of the spectral gap ($\lambda_1 > 0$) across system boundaries.

## Mathematical Context
In the URF ecosystem, the Exchange Force is analyzed via the coupling of two or more operator systems $H_A$ and $H_B$. The framework ensures that the interaction term $V_{int}$ does not collapse the global rigidity:
$$\text{Spec}(\Delta_{A+B}) \approx \text{Spec}(\Delta_A) \otimes \text{Spec}(\Delta_B)$$
This ensures that the "Exchange" maintains the deterministic integrity of the constituent parts.

## Artifacts & Manuscripts
* **Core Definitions:** Locked (v1.0.2).
* **Formal Closure:** In progress (Projected 2026).
* **Verification Certificates:** Future artifacts will be registered via URF-SG JSON standards.

## Status
**Framework / Conditional.** Definitions are locked. Formal closure of the relational coupling axioms is the current research priority.

## Research Status

The exchange force framework is conceptually closed.
Remaining work concerns application-specific instantiations.
